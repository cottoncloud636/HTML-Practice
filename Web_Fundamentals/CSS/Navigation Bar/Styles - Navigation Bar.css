/* take aways for this assignment:
1) class nav is one big div, h1 is first sub div, nav-links is the seond sub div. 
So all list under nav-links are treated as a whole, they move together when play with nav.
BUT, under nav-links, there are 4 children, we don't need to write div to apply flex property, as long we apply in a parent and children relation, the flex can work
2) in nav div, if we apply background first w/o applying any size to this container, we will see the color will include all the content, that is because nav is a div, and when apply background color, it include all its children.
