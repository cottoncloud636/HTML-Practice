 Project Description: 
 
New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: Calculator (not sure this will be too complicated, otherwise I will create a formula.) And also I want to learn BootStrap and API.

Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2): at least get login and register page ready, 

Week 2 Features (to show at the first office hour/lecture of Week 3): be able to show real-time rates through API.


Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...)
